# SkilliVanilli-Wardrop

   Wadrop is an app that lets the user keep track of his entire wardrobe by uploading each clothing item onto the app. You may also choose to create outfits using the already uploaded clothes so as to reduce the time spent in the morning on deciding on what to wear. The app tries to combat the habit of buying unnecessary clothes and encourages the user to wear everything in his wardrobe.
   The app was developed in Android Studio, using Java, XML and SQLite.
